* [x] Add security key generation to encode messages with and decode them

* [x] Add encrypt and decrypt RSA algorithm

* [x] Add sending data and receiving data with connection control (SYN INCREMENT)

* [x] Add the encryption and decryption to the protocol

* [x] Add message format for now JSON

* [x] Add handshake to each message

* [x] Test transmission protocol (encryption, handshakes, plausible exploits).

* [ ] Add request type to the message (GET PUT DELETE  etc.)

* [ ] Make the encryption smarter

* [ ] Add data chunkinator at application level

...
